# Post a scalar measurement

When you have defined your sensor, measurements have to be POSTed using HTTP to:

```
https://www.senio.io/publish/<sensor_name>
```

Where <sensor_name> is replaced with the name of your sensor, in our exmaple it would be:

```
https://www.senio.io/publish/rpi
```

Scalar measurements are posted as JSON (and images as multipart form data, but they can be combined).

Assuming you have a sensor set up as previously described, you can post some dummy data first using the "post_dummy_dht22.py" script:

```
$ ./post_dummy_dht22.py
----- CONFIG -----
url: https://www.senio.io/publish/rpi
key: aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa
-------------------
Temp: 22.0 Humidity: 50.0
Status: 201
Content:     b'{"timestamp":1474383378795.2,"data":{"temp":22,"humidity":50},"tags":null}'
```

Now let's look at the python code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import time
import requests
import sys

from senio_config import SenioConfig
config = SenioConfig()

humidity, temp = 50.0, 22.0
print('Temp: {} Humidity: {}'.format(temp, humidity))

try:
    response = requests.post(
        config.url,
        headers={
            'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(config.key)
        },
        json={
            'timestamp': time.time()*1000,
            'data': {
                'temp': temp,
                'humidity': humidity
            }
        })
    print('Status: {}'.format(response.status_code))
    print('Content: {}'.format(response.content))
except:
    print('Unexpected error:', sys.exc_info()[0])
```

There is some boilerplate and debug statements, but the important statement is **requests.post**. 

Note the following:

- The URL contains the name of the sensor.
- The "Authorization" header contains "Bearer " + the device key of the sensor.
- If the "Authorization" header is not correctly formatted or the device key is wrong, the server will response with a 403 status code.
- The data is JSON-encoded.
- The timestamp is in **milliseconds**. Python's time.time() will return a value in microseconds so we multiply with 1000
