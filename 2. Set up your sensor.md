# Set up your sensor

After you've set up your sensor on senio.io, it's time to check that you can post measurements from the device.

*NOTE:* You can test these steps on a desktop machine before you try it on your device.

## Prerequisites

 - Python3
 - The Python [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library
 - The [senio-client](https://github.com/bjnortier/senio-client) library
 
```
    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.5.1
    
    $ pip3 install requests
    ...
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/bjnortier/senio-client.git
    ...
    
    $ cd senio-client
```

### Configure the client

To post measurements to senio.io, the device uses the name of the sensor and the device key. The device key authorizes the sensor (see ["Create a sensor"](https://github.com/bjnortier/senio-docs/blob/master/1.%20Create%20a%20sensor.md) in the docs).

The senio-client example code has a configuration file containing this information to make this easier. You are of course welcome to use your own implementation to post measurements!

Copy the senio.ini.UPDATE_ME_WITH_SENSOR_VALUES to senio.ini:

```
    $ cp senio.ini.UPDATE_ME_WITH_SENSOR_VALUES senio.ini
```

Update the sensor name and key to the values from senio.io:

```
    [sensor]
    name=rpi
    key=aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa
```

Check your setup by running the check.py script:

```
    $ ./check_config.py
    ----- CONFIG -----
    url: https://www.senio.io/publish/rpi
    key: aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa
    -------------------
    Status: 200
    Content: b'"Valid sensor and key"'
```
