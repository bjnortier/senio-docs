# Set up your sensor

After you've set up your sensor on senio.io, it's time to check that you can post measurements from the device.

*NOTE:* You can test these steps on a desktop machine before you try it on your device.

## Prerequisites

 - Python3
 - The Python [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library
 - The [senio-client](https://github.com/bjnortier/senio-client) library
 
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.5.1

$ pip3 install requests
...

$ git clone https://github.com/bjnortier/senio-client.git
...

$ cd senio-client
```

### Configure the client

To post measurements to senio.io, the device uses the name of the sensor and the device key. The device key is used to authorize the sensor (see ["Create a sensor"](https://github.com/bjnortier/senio-docs/blob/master/1.%20Create%20a%20sensor.md) in the docs).

The senio-client example code has a configuration file containing this information to make this easier. You are of course welcome to use your own implementation to post measurements!

First copy the template config file senio.ini.UPDATE_ME_WITH_SENSOR_VALUES to senio.ini:

```
$ cp senio.ini.UPDATE_ME_WITH_SENSOR_VALUES senio.ini
```

Edit the **senio.ini** file and update the sensor name and key to the values of the sensor you created on senio.io:

```
[sensor]
name=rpi
key=aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa
```

Now you can check your setup by running the check.py script:

```
$ python3 check_config.py 
----- CONFIG -----
url: http://dev-senio.io:3000/publish/test sensor
key: 18d7edbb-6a87-4a29-9a41-64203d8fa0d7
-------------------
Status: 200
Content: b'{"name":"test sensor","fields":{
  "temp":{"unit":"celsius","type":"scalar"},
  "humidity":{"unit":"relative %","type":"scalar"},
  "cam1":{"unit":"","type":"image"}}}'
```

The check.py script will perform a GET request using the device key. If you get a Status 200 back, you're good to go üëçüèª
